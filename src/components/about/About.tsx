          Hello, my name is Tomek and I am programming for several years.
          Firstly I was learning mainly Java, Python (Django framework), but in
          2022 I decided that web development is the thing I really love to do.

        <p className="mt-3">
          I like to combine the Frontend with Backend and have control about the
          both layers. I am constantly learning by creating projects (now Iâ€™m
          keen on FPLTools one) and adding new features and libraries to them. I
          am fast learner and I really want to have opportunity to show my
          skills in commercial project.
